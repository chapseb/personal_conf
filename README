ZSH main configuration files, user specifi configuration files,
utilities functions and theme for my personal use.

Each .zshrc-{username} contains specific user information. Yous should just 
copy or create the following symlinks:
ln -s .zshrc-trasher ~/.zshrc-${whoami}
ln -s .zshrc ~/
ln -s .zsh_functions ~/
